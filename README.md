Project Relevance: 
Any level of applied Data Science requires data as its primary resource. Larger the quantity of data, better is the scope of generating useful insights. The most abundant source of information today is the internet. Thus, being able to copy/extract data off the internet is of vital importance to Data Science. It can often become inconvenient to manually extract data off the internet. This project is an attempt towards learning alternative methods of data extraction which are less time consuming and help direct human energy to other more complex tasks.

Language Used: 
Python is a very powerful high level programming language. It provides several free open source libraries that extend its capabilities. For the first part of this project, 'yfinance' library extracts historical price data of Tesla. For the second part of this project, the read_html() function of pandas extracts annual revenue data of Tesla. There was also the option of using BeautifulSoup library, which has not been pursued for reasons best mentioned in the project.

Data Sources:
a) https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/TSLA/
b) https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/TSLA/tesla/revenue
